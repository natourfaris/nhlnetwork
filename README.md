Who is the Kevin Bacon of the NHL? Or, that One Time Wendel Clark Was on the Red Wings
==============================

I do some network analysis on the relationships between players in the NHL to try to find the most "connected" NHL player of all time. This project was helped immensely by the documentation of the NHL API by [Drew Hynes](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi). 

To go through the analysis, click [here](https://github.com/natourfaris/nhlnetwork/blob/master/notebooks/Analysis.ipynb).

## Warning: 

If you do decide to replicate the project from scratch and download the full NHL historical game and player data for yourself, do keep in mind that this data takes a *long* time to download. It personally took me around 15 hours to get the full dataset. I will try in the future to see if I can share the dataset so others won't have to download it for themselves. In the meantime, I did provide the graph as a json file which you can find in the data folder of the project.

Similar to the above, calculating the lengths of the shortest paths between players also takes a significant amount of time. Do keep that in mind if you do decide to go down that route.
