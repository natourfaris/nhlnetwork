nhlNetwork
==============================

Who is the Kevin Bacon of the NHL?

I do some network analysis on the relationships between players in the NHL to try to find the most "connected" NHL player of all time. This project was helped immensely by the documentation of the NHL API by [Drew Hynes](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi). 

To go through the analysis, click [here](https://github.com/natourfaris/nhlnetwork/blob/master/notebooks/Analysis.ipynb).
