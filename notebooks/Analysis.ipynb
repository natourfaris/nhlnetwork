    "# Who is the Kevin Bacon of the NHL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of us are familiar with the [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) game. Pick an actor, then try to find a path of castmates to connect them to the actor Kevin Bacon. The number of connections in the shortest path it takes to connect that actor to Mr. Bacon is said to be that actor's \"Bacon number\". Thus, Tom Hanks has a Bacon number of 1, because he was in Apollo 13 with KB. Alfred Hitchcock has a Bacon number of 2 (he appeared in his movie The Birds, which had actress Tippi Hedren, who appeared with KB in the movie Jayne Mansfield's Car). So does [noted Auston Matthews friend](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6kXtplnV3D/?utm_source=ig_embed) Justin Bieber (he appeared with Kiefer Sutherland in Zoolander 2, who himself appeared with KB in the original 1990 Flatliners). Charlie Chaplin is a 3 (in Monsieur Verdoux with Marjorie Bennett, who was in Charley Varrick with Joe Don Baker, who was in Criminal Law with KB; yeah, I don't know any of those people or movies either, thank you [Oracle of Bacon](https://oracleofbacon.org/)). KB is a prolific actor. He has appeared in close to 70 movies, and his career has seen him appear with a wide range of actors. Indeed, it's quite difficult to find an actor whose Bacon number is more than a 3, and this is where the fun of the game comes in. Trying to piece together careers and collborations to figure out the answer is an interesting diversion for the most obsessed of movie buffs. And the real fun part is when someone makes an obscure connection that makes everyone else go, \"X WAS IN WHAT MOVIE?!?!?!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I've recently come to learn about graph theory, a branch of mathematics that is used to answer questions related to, among other things, social networks. I immediately thought of the Six Degrees game and its more obscure relative: the [Erdos number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number). And then I started to wonder who would the equivalent person in other social networks be. Hockey in particular has a reputation for being a [small world](https://nationalpost.com/sports/hockey/nhl/calgary-flames/flames-pto-macdonalds-connection-to-straschnitzki-family-proves-hockey-is-a-small-world/wcm/a052253e-5c79-4fe0-a53c-87e08d80bde7).  While it is widely-accepted among hockey fans that the Toronto Maple Leafs are in fact the centre of the hockey universe, it would be interesting to see which actual player sits closest to that."

    "## Data, Setup, and Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the [NHL website's API](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi) to download data on all games that were ever played in the history of the NHL. I also used it to download data on all players who were part of the roster of those games. The data I used runs from the 1917-18 season through the 2017-18 season. 100 years seems like very appropriate bookends for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect 2 players with each other, they must have simply played 1 regular season NHL game with each other. No playoffs, no preseason games, and definitely no All-Star games. The two players need to have been teammates. Given that, I toyed with only considering players who played a significant number of games with each other (a half-season or the like) to be connected, but I think this goes against the spirit of connection games. Like I mentioned before, extremely obscure trivia is after all where the fun of these games lies. Keeping the standard lax ensures that's maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some things that would help a player be more \"central\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* They have played a large number of games in the NHL. Immediately, that gives an advantage to players who have had longevity. Playing a 1000 games helps, playing 1200 helps a lot, and playing 1500 games almost guarantees being near the top of this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Playing on many different teams is also really helpful. Think about it: if a player signs a UFA contract to stay with their current team, their teammates the following year will largely be the same. However, if they sign with a completely different team, chances are they won't have played with any of the players on that new team at the professional level. This is a much bigger opportunity for creating new connections. Players who get traded a lot or those that signed with several different teams as free agents will get the benefit of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Playing with other central players is also extremely helpful. If a player X played with Y, and Y played with A,B,C,D, and E, those are all now 2nd degree connections of X. A player who plays with several players like this without those players playing with each other will be classified as more central. This is not exactly what we're looking for, and I will be looking for a way to detect that. There's no real science here, but it feels more interesting to find someone who has truly played with many players.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above, I can think of a couple of names that seem to fit there requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jaromir Jagr, who played 1733 games in the NHL over 24 years with 9 different teams\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mike Sillinger, who played in over a 1000 games with 12 different teams. He was traded a whopping 9 times (both of those are NHL records)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ~~Toronto Maple Leafs~~ ~~St. Louis Blues~~ Florida Panthers legend Olli Jokinen: 1200+ games, 7 teams\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's see if any of those guesses holds up! The rest of this notebook goes through my code. If you don't want to muck about with that, you can skip ahead to the results to see what I find."

    "## General Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "My \"scrape_data.py\" script was used to scrape the NHL website of player and game data. I will use this data to create a bipartite graph with player and game partitions. Each game will have two nodes, one for the home team and one for the away team, and player nodes will be linked to those game nodes as appropriate. I will then project this bipartite graph onto an undirected, unweighted graph with no partitions containing only player nodes and the edges that connect them. Using this graph, I will calculate the length of the shortest paths between every node pair. I will then use those lengths to find the average shortest path of each node and thus the most \"central\" player.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see an example of what the bipartite graph will look like. This allows us to match only players who have played games with each other. These players played in the game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Ottawa Senators on December 5th, 2016. Notice that there are two game nodes associated with this game, one for the home team Penguins and another for the visiting Senators. This is because I am linking only players who have played with one another on the same team. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../reports/figures/bipartite.png' alt='Illustration of bipartite'>\n",
    "\n",
    "I then project the bipartite graph onto the player nodes to create a simple undirected graph. The new graph's nodes are for players only. Any players that were connected to the same game node in the bipartite graph will now be connected to each other in the new graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../reports/figures/bipartite2.png' alt='Projected graph'>\n",

By doing a sanity check on the number of unique players that have ever played in the league, I arrive at 7710 players, compared to 7731 players according to the NHL website. I arrived at this number by using the NHL website's [statistics page](http://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters), where searching for all players by season from 1917-18 to 2017-18 for the regular season yields 6945 skaters and 786 goalies.

I will also calculate the length of the shortest path between every pair of players. This is by definition the degree distance between each player pair. Two players X and Y that played with each other have a shortest path length of 1, and thus player X's Y number is 1, and vice versa.

    "And there's an interesting result! It turns out, Mark Messier is the most \"accessible\" player in the history of the NHL. Put simply, it takes on average 2.43 steps to connect any player in the history of the league to Messier. He is followed by Gordie Roberts, a US Hockey Hall of Famer who player close to 1100 games in the NHL spending a large portion of his career with the Minnesota North Stars. My initial guesses of Jagr and Sillinger are not too far off, with some interesting players who have been around the league in Doug Gilmour and Marc Bergevin. Where did Jokinen place?"

    "There's no real answer to that question. As I said before, I think the real fun of six degrees games is the trivia it brings to light and the fun of piecing together the careers of the people in question. The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game reportedly [started out similarly, with several friends snowed in, drunk, and watching TV](https://www.npr.org/2012/09/14/161130024/the-history-of-six-degrees-of-kevin-bacon) who had then realized just how many movies KB had been in. The choice of KB, while certainly very good, was coincidental. So it feels wrong to try to call any one player a centre of the NHL player universe, and I think it goes to the reader to decide for themselves who that person should be."

    "We here find mostly a list of almost-forgotten names who had been part of the NHL briefly at one point or another during its formative years. Bernie Morris had a 20 year career around several leagues like the PCHA and the minor Canadian Professional Hockey League, including 6 games with the Boston Bruins. Art Ross, for whom the trophy is named, had a similarly long career, finishing it with 3 games with the Montreal Wanderers in the league's first season. Fred Doherty played mostly before the NHL was founded, including one game with the Toronto Blueshirts, whose ownership's hostilities with other team owners of the NHA led to the foundation of the NHL. Bob Hall played 8 games with the New York Americans for a month in 1926. And all the way at the top, the least central, the loneliest player in the history of the NHL, George McNaughton, who played one game for the Quebec Bulldogs, on January 1st, 1918, against the original Ottawa Senators.\n",
